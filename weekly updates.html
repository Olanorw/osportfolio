	<h3>Week 20</h3>
		<p>This week, I've been working on this website, and also learning a new programming language - Java! I'm using Java to create minecraft plugins. I'm also teaching my friend.  I've also been doing a lot of schoolwork recently. I've had 3 projects at the same time this week.</p>
	<h3>Week 19</h3>
		<p>Building this website! Not looking forward to the rainy Saturday and Sunday. I have a swim meet both days for a couple hours. Gonna be really cold. Hope I don't get a cold or fever! :D</p>
