	<h1>Weekly Updates</h1>
	<hr>
	<h3>Week 24</h3>
		<p>Got my fever back on sunday. I think I went back to school a bit too early. I'm updating this on friday, and feel a lot better! :) I'm returning to C# after 2 years to make another VR game using Unity. Almost lost all of my assets, but realized I was on the wrong account. I'm really excited to make this game, because I finally found out how to get my XR rigs to work with steamVR as well as oculus's openXR runtime..</p>
	<h3>Week 23</h3>
		<p>Got really sick this week. Just came home and am editing this on friday. Very congested. Not really in the mood/condition to do that much other than homework right now. Hope to feel a bit better soon.</p>
	<h3>Week 22</h3>
		<p>I'm pretty excited to ski this weekend at Dodge Ridge. I have made my first full-fledged minecraft server moderation plugin using java. This is great progress! :) I have found out how to use Azure's cognitive speech to text services and text to speech services to have a conversation with AI. This is pretty cool.</p>
	<h3>Week 21</h3>
		<p>Am excited I have pretty soon, am making great progress with Java. I'm also starting to develop AI with python. - gpt's integration. My dad gave me $5 worth of tokens to develop with. I've played chess with AI Napoleon! :) I am starting to get used to 2nd period PE again. It's still really cold.</p>
	<h3>Week 20</h3>
		<p>This week, I've been working on this website, and also learning a new programming language - Java! I'm using Java to create minecraft plugins. I'm also teaching my friend.  I've also been doing a lot of schoolwork recently. I've had 3 projects at the same time this week.</p>
	<h3>Week 19</h3>
		<p>Building this website! Not looking forward to the rainy Saturday and Sunday. I have a swim meet both days for a couple hours. Gonna be really cold. Hope I don't get a cold or fever! :D</p>
